    <h3>Description:<h3>

    <p>The recipe for a decent life is rather difficult. Only skilled chefs are able to pull it off.</p>
    
    <h4>Ingredients:<h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Family/Friends (sometimes they are interchangeable)</li>
        <li>Love (and I mean platonic love - being in a relationship is NOT required for 100% completion)</li>
        <li>A LOT of money (they say money isn't everything, but have you seen the price of rent?)</li>
        <li>Onions, Bell Peppers, Mushrooms, etc.</li>
      </ul>
    <h4>Steps:<h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Be present.</li>
        <li>Work hard.</li>
        <li>Try not to get distracted.</li>
      </ol>
    <p>And that's about it! Enjoy!</p>
